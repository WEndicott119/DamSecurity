### What are we doing?
Cybersecurity assessments are an all-encompassing task to review a project. These assessments range from ensuring a company’s physical network infrastructure is secure to discovering any vulnerabilities in remote attacks. Instead of creating a new technology that will be faster or more efficient, our primary goal is to ensure safety for businesses and the public. The threat of competitors causes companies to release technology as fast as possible however this speed comes with the risk of vulnerabilities. Our project aims to discover and patch any vulnerabilities in cybersecurity assessments to safeguard our clients.

Security assessments aim to prevent unauthorized access to data and data leaks, thus protecting the client from the inconveniences of a breach, including liability issues and data loss. In addition, it would save their clients from having their data stolen and, in cases where their clients reused passwords, used to gain access to users’ other accounts.  Furthermore, It will save users time needed to change passwords due to a breach. Finally, it will save the client time and money because the project’s security would not have to be fixed when a breach occurs.

### Success Measures

With the recent creation of competition projects, the true scope of a completed project is still a mystery. However, the end goal we have decided for ourselves is to generate comprehensive cybersecurity reports on numerous projects. These reports will include how we conducted our assessment, the vulnerabilities found, and our recommendations for fixing these weaknesses. Most of our work will occur on finding any possible vulnerabilities with the projects we assess. Then, produce various parts such as threat models and in-depth vulnerability research. Finally, the final report will pass through a concluding judgment with multiple criteria.

### The judging criteria regarding the security team competition are as follows:
#### •	Thoroughness in identifying vulnerabilities.
#### •	Clarity and completeness in consultation documents
#### •	Communications success in helping a functional team or past project fixing vulnerabilities.

Ensuring our reports are extensive and contain all relevant information, as stated above, will make this project successful.

### Stakeholders

The creator of the assessed project is a key stakeholder in the success of the security analysis. The creator would be held liable for their users’ stolen information in a breach, especially when there is a legal requirement for that information not to be shared. The assessed project could have important data that is integral to its functionality. If that data were deleted or changed, the assessed project could be compromised. A competing company could steal proprietary information, allowing them to rise above the company of the assessed project. Many of these issues could have high financial and reputational costs, which could be avoided if a thorough security analysis was done before vulnerabilities were exploited.

The users of the assessed project will have a stake in whether we do a reliable job in running a security analysis because the users of the assessed project will have personal information linked to the project’s database. Ensuring a closed and secure system will minimize any vulnerabilities or possible exploitations to gain access to the project user’s data. An unsuccessful measure could mean a difference in the privacy and protection of the users for the project, putting the users at risk for serious threats and harm. A cyber attacker could use the information of the project’s users to log into accounts and potentially cause serious damage to the user’s systems or privacy. By having a direct link to the project through personal information, the project's users hold a stake within our security team project.


### Breakdown of our Github Repo

We broke down each project we began working on into their own induvial folder will each document we created for them. This includes threat model’s, Security Reports, and decomposition of the project created by our team to run teaming on. Projects that we began to work with that eventually fell out are still included to help document work that we done along the way. Two projects that are currently being worked on by other teams are included. Juno and Real Estate CRM are two teams that will be contacting the team once their projects are hosted to run the automated testing.

### Why are we better?
DamSecurity strives to provide the best service in security assessments around. This company has been around so long that each other the companies have gone out of business(joke about being the only security team).


## Steps for next group doing a similar project

### Framework

Understanding what frame your group will use might be the most important first step. You won't be limited to just one since the idea is that you'll perform assessments on multiple projects. The goal would be to understand what a framework is what it represents. some of the most popular frameworks to work with include HIPAA, NIST, GDPR, PCI-DSS, and MITRE.

Make sure to understand and be prepared to refence your framework guildeline multiple times throughout the project. Here is an explaination of a high level overview of cybersecurity frameworks.

Cybersecurity frameworks are structured approaches that organizations use to manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. The goals of cybersecurity frameworks include:

1. Providing a structured approach: Cybersecurity frameworks provide a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risks. They provide a common language and methodology for managing cybersecurity risks, which helps organizations to effectively identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks.

2. Enhancing cybersecurity posture: The goal of cybersecurity frameworks is to enhance an organization's cybersecurity posture. This involves reducing the likelihood and impact of cybersecurity incidents, as well as improving the organization's ability to detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents.

3. Compliance: Cybersecurity frameworks are designed to help organizations comply with relevant cybersecurity regulations, standards, and guidelines. Compliance with these regulations and guidelines helps organizations to avoid legal and financial penalties, as well as reputational damage.

4. Aligning cybersecurity with business objectives: Cybersecurity frameworks aim to align cybersecurity with business objectives. This involves ensuring that cybersecurity measures are aligned with the organization's strategic goals and that they support the organization's overall mission.

5. Continuous improvement: Cybersecurity frameworks are designed to support continuous improvement of an organization's cybersecurity posture. This involves regularly reviewing and updating the cybersecurity measures in place, as well as monitoring for new cybersecurity risks and emerging threats.

### Network and ask for advice

During the duration of the project our team reached out to multiple cybersecurity professionals to get advice and ask for their point of view of how they approach things. Each one of our team members reached out and connected to at least one person. This can be on twitter, LinkedIn, OSUSOC, or security club members. Reach out to anyone and everyone!

### Hands on experience 

This could be anyway you feel comfortable. HackTheBox, TryHackMe, PortSwingger, or even just downloading tools and practicing. Figuring out 1 or 2 automated tools that run multiple tests on an application or network is a great way to know what you're end goal is going to be. Practice scanning and using the tools on scanme.nmap.org and other proxy web apps.

### Potential projects or challenges 

-Building your own SIEM stack to monitor and analyze security events. This is a project that has many examples and can be built in different ways. the team can build their preference of a stack that can be tested and used. They can then write their own SOP(standard operating procedure) on how to use their SIEM and the different capabilities.

This link has an example of a SIEM that is being built
