### Success Measures

With the recent creation of competition projects, the true scope of a completed project is still a mystery. However, the end goal we have decided for ourselves is to generate comprehensive cybersecurity reports on numerous projects. These reports will include how we conducted our assessment, the vulnerabilities found, and our recommendations for fixing these weaknesses. Most of our work will occur on finding any possible vulnerabilities with the projects we assess. Then, produce various parts such as threat models and in-depth vulnerability research. Finally, the final report will pass through a concluding judgment with multiple criteria.

### The judging criteria regarding the security team competition are as follows:
#### •	Thoroughness in identifying vulnerabilities.
#### •	Clarity and completeness in consultation documents
#### •	Communications success in helping a functional team or past project fixing vulnerabilities.

Ensuring our reports are extensive and contain all relevant information, as stated above, will make this project successful.

### Stakeholders

The creator of the assessed project is a key stakeholder in the success of the security analysis. The creator would be held liable for their users’ stolen information in a breach, especially when there is a legal requirement for that information not to be shared. The assessed project could have important data that is integral to its functionality. If that data were deleted or changed, the assessed project could be compromised. A competing company could steal proprietary information, allowing them to rise above the company of the assessed project. Many of these issues could have high financial and reputational costs, which could be avoided if a thorough security analysis was done before vulnerabilities were exploited.

The users of the assessed project will have a stake in whether we do a reliable job in running a security analysis because the users of the assessed project will have personal information linked to the project’s database. Ensuring a closed and secure system will minimize any vulnerabilities or possible exploitations to gain access to the project user’s data. An unsuccessful measure could mean a difference in the privacy and protection of the users for the project, putting the users at risk for serious threats and harm. A cyber attacker could use the information of the project’s users to log into accounts and potentially cause serious damage to the user’s systems or privacy. By having a direct link to the project through personal information, the project's users hold a stake within our security team project.


### Breakdown of our Github Repo

We broke down each project we began working on into their own induvial folder will each document we created for them. This includes threat model’s, Security Reports, and decomposition of the project created by our team to run teaming on. Projects that we began to work with that eventually fell out are still included to help document work that we done along the way. Two projects that are currently being worked on by other teams are included. Juno and Real Estate CRM are two teams that will be contacting the team once their projects are hosted to run the automated testing.

### Why are we better?
DamSecurity strives to provide the best service in security assessments around. This company has been around so long that each other the companies have gone out of business(joke about being the only security team).
